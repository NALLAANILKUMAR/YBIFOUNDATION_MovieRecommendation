## Introduction

This project implements a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to generate recommendations.

## Features

- **User-based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similar movies liked by the user.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the content of the movies and user preferences.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Allows users to interact with the recommendation system through a web interface.

## Installation

1. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Download the movie dataset (e.g., [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)).
    - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Preprocess the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

3. Train the recommendation model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Run the web application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the system.

## Dataset

The project uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), a popular dataset for movie recommendation systems. Ensure you download and place the dataset files in the `data/` directory before running the preprocessing scripts.

## Notebooks

This project includes Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation and experimentation of the recommendation algorithms:

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
    - [Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb](path/to/Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb): Implementation of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms.

- **Movie Recommendation System**:
    - [Movie Recommendation.ipynb](path/to/Movie Recommendation.ipynb): Comprehensive notebook demonstrating the full pipeline of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

To run these notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
