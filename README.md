# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using the dataset provided in the `Movies Recommendation.csv` file. The recommendation system will suggest movies based on various factors such as genre, ratings, and user preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `Movies Recommendation.csv` and contains information about various movies. Below are the details of the dataset:

- **Title**: The title of the movie.
- **Genre**: The genre(s) of the movie.
- **Rating**: The rating of the movie.
- **User Preferences**: Any specific user preferences related to the movie.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (or any other machine learning library you plan to use)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for exploring the data and prototyping)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NALLAANILKUMAR/movies-recommendation.git
    cd movies-recommendation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Load the dataset:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('Movies Recommendation.csv')
    ```

2. Explore the dataset:

    ```python
    print(df.head())
    ```

3. Develop and train your recommendation model. Example using a simple collaborative filtering approach:

    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

    # Your model code here
    ```

4. Make recommendations:

    ```python
    # Your recommendation code here
    ```

### Example

Here's an example of how to load and explore the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Movies Recommendation.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
